# Changelog

All notable changes to Knot are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning

- Tags are cut as `vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `v0.0.1`).
- The single source of truth for the current version is `src/knot/version.clj`,
  surfaced to users via `knot --version` and the `knot --help` banner.
- Version bumps are driven by the `/release` slash command.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-29

Initial release. Knot is a file-based ticket store for AI-assisted development:
plain Markdown tickets with YAML front-matter under `.tickets/`, queried and
mutated through a babashka CLI.

### Added

- Project setup: `knot init` walks up from cwd to write `.knot.edn`, derives a
  prefix from the project directory name, and seeds the `.tickets/` tree.
- Lifecycle transitions: `knot create`, `show`, `status`, `start`, `close`,
  `reopen`, plus automatic moves between `.tickets/` and `.tickets/archive/`
  when a ticket reaches a terminal status.
- Discovery and listing: `knot ls`, `ready`, `blocked`, `closed`, with filters
  for `--status / --assignee / --tag / --type / --mode` and a `--limit` cap.
- Dependency graph: `knot dep` / `undep` for cycle-checked edges, `dep tree`
  for the recursive view, and `dep cycle` for repo-wide cycle detection.
- Symmetric links: `knot link` and `unlink` with computed inverse sections
  rendered in `show`.
- Annotation: `knot add-note` (positional / piped / `$EDITOR`) and `knot edit`
  for full-file editing, with a `--summary` field threaded through close.
- Session priming: `knot prime` emits an agent-directive primer, safe to wire
  into a SessionStart hook even outside a Knot project.
- Structured help system: `knot --help`, `knot help <cmd>`, and per-command
  `--help` / `-h`, with a single registry as the source of truth for both the
  parser spec and the rendered help.
- JSON output: every read command accepts `--json` for machine-readable output;
  TTY-aware color discipline keeps piped output clean.
- Distribution: `bbin` install metadata in `bb.edn` and a Clojure/babashka
  install path documented in the README.
- `knot --version` and a version banner on `knot --help`.
