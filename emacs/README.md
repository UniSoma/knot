# knot.el

Emacs UI for the [knot](../README.md) CLI: tabulated-list views, a
markdown-view-mode show buffer, transient menus for every mutation,
capture buffers for long-form fields, and a dedicated dep-tree view.

## Install

The package is a single file (`knot.el`) and depends on
[`markdown-mode`](https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode). With
`straight.el`:

```elisp
(use-package knot
  :straight (knot :type git :host github :repo "UniSoma/knot"
                  :files ("emacs/knot.el"))
  :commands (knot knot-list knot-show))
```

`M-x knot` opens the dispatch transient. Project detection mirrors
`magit-toplevel` — the buffer's `default-directory` is anchored to
the project root resolved by `knot info --json`.

## Global navigation

`knot-find-id-at-point` opens the show buffer for the ticket id
under point from any buffer — prose notes, source comments, magit
log, dired, anywhere the project's id shape (`<prefix>-01<base32>`)
appears as plain text. Point may be on or adjacent to the id, like
`find-file-at-point`. Partial ids resolve via the CLI's partial-id
contract. `q` in the resulting show buffer returns to the call
site, including when the show buffer already existed from an
earlier session. With no id at point the command signals
`user-error "No knot id at point"` rather than prompting — use
`M-x knot-show` (or `?` → `s`) for the prompt path.

Suggested global bind:

```elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c k v") #'knot-find-id-at-point)
```

## Evil / Doom users

`knot-evil-mode` is an opt-in global minor mode that rewires knot.el's
read-only buffers for evil normal state. `evil` is a soft dependency;
the package loads without it, and toggling the mode on raises
`user-error` when evil is missing.

Activation is destructive in the evil-collection sense — the setup
function strips the colliding stock-Emacs bindings from each
`knot-*-mode-map` and adds the new bindings via `evil-define-key*`
into each mode's auxiliary keymap for normal state. The mode is
idempotent; toggling it off does not restore the original bindings
(reload `knot.el` to revert).

### Binding table

All bindings live in evil **normal state**. Visual state is unbound
(no bulk-action workflow). `knot-capture-mode` opens in **insert**
state; `C-c C-c` commits and `C-c C-k` discards regardless of state.

`m` / `u` / `U` add dired-style marks to `knot-list-mode` rows. `m`
marks the row at point and advances one line; `u` unmarks and
advances; `U` clears the entire set. With an active region, `m` and
`u` operate on every overlapping row and deactivate the mark.
Marked rows render a `*` in the padding column and the
`knot-marked` face on the row body; the header-line gains a
`[N marked]` chunk while the set is non-empty. The set is buffer-
local and survives refresh (`g` / `gr`), filter changes, and sort
changes — point is preserved across refresh on the same row id,
and ids that fall out of view (e.g. after a filter change or an
external mutation) silently drop. Switching view with `l` / `r` /
`b` / `c` clears the set, since the row set is conceptually
different across views.

When `knot-update-from-show` (`,` / `M`) is invoked in
`knot-list-mode` with marks non-empty, each frontmatter suffix
fans out across the marked set: the prompt prefixes a
`(N marked)` chunk and offers no default value, then one
`knot update --<flag> <value>` subprocess runs per id in display
order. Per-id `user-error` failures are caught and the loop
continues; a single `knot--after-mutation` refresh fires once at
the end. The minibuffer reports the outcome as `M: K ok` or
`M: K ok, F failed: <id> (reason), …`. Marks persist across the
run, and rows that fall out of the current view (e.g. status
flipped to closed under the `ready` view) auto-prune at refresh
time. With marks empty the existing single-id behavior applies
(operate on the row at point, current-value default still
prefills). `s` (start) and `x` (close) remain single-id; bulk
long-form mutation (`e d b n`) is intentionally excluded.

`+` in `knot-show-mode` is section-aware. It reads the
`knot-section` text property at point and dispatches:
`## Acceptance Criteria` → `knot-show-add-ac`, `## Blockers` →
`knot-deps-add`, `## Linked` → `knot-links-add`, `## Blocking` →
`knot-show-add-rdep` (adds a ticket that depends on the current
one). When point is outside any of those four sections, `+` pops
`knot-show-add-transient` (`a` acceptance, `d` dep, `l` link). The
four `+`-aware sections are always rendered, with an italic
placeholder when empty.

`-` and `K` both call `knot-show-remove-at-point`, the symmetric
remover — dispatching on the row's text property: a `## Blockers`
row → `knot undep`, a `## Blocking` row → reverse `knot undep`, a
`## Linked` row → `knot unlink`, an acceptance row → `--remove-ac`.
`-` shadows evil's `evil-previous-line-first-non-blank` motion in
knot-show buffers; use `k` for up-line.

The `M` transient owns every field mutation and opens from both
`knot-show-mode` and `knot-list-mode` (operating on the row at point
in the latter). Frontmatter suffixes (`s` status, `p` priority, `m`
mode, `t` type, `T` tags, `a` assignee, `P` parent) are always
offered; long-form suffixes (`e` description, `d` design, `b` body,
`n` note) are shown only in `knot-show-mode` — drill into a row via
`RET` first to edit long-form sections. The standalone show-mode
bindings for `e d b n` are dropped when `knot-evil-mode` is on; they
collide with evil operators and motions.

### Doom Emacs

Paste-ready snippet for `~/.doom.d/packages.el` + `config.el`:

```elisp
;; packages.el
(package! knot
  :recipe (:host github :repo "UniSoma/knot" :files ("emacs/knot.el")))
```

```elisp
;; config.el
(use-package! knot
  :commands (knot knot-list knot-show)
  :config
  (knot-evil-mode +1)
  (map! :map (knot-list-mode-map knot-show-mode-map
              knot-info-mode-map knot-deps-mode-map)
        :localleader
        :desc "Dispatch"  "?" #'knot
        :desc "Refresh"   "r" #'knot-refresh
        :desc "Start"     "s" #'knot-start
        :desc "Close"     "x" #'knot-close
        :desc "Modify"    "M" #'knot-update-from-show
        :desc "Deps"      "D" #'knot-deps-transient
        :desc "Links"     "L" #'knot-links-transient)
  (map! :map knot-list-mode-map
        :localleader
        :desc "Filter"    "f" #'knot-list-filter
        :desc "Sort"      "o" #'knot-list-sort))
```

Doom users typically alias `,` to localleader, so `,` is not bound by
`knot-evil-mode`; the `M` binding replaces the non-evil `,` keymap
entry that opens the update transient in both `knot-show-mode` and
`knot-list-mode`.
